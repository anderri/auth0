Auth0 JSON Utilities
This repository contains two Python scripts designed to process JSON data for use with Auth0. These scripts are particularly useful for fixing and preparing JSON files generated by the Auth0 Import/Export extension, making them suitable for import into a different Auth0 tenant.

Scripts Overview
1. convert_flat_to_nested.py
Description:
This script converts a flat JSON structure with dot-separated keys into a nested JSON object. It's especially useful when you need to restructure JSON data to match specific requirements, such as those needed for SAML assertions or other hierarchical data formats.

How It Works:
Reads a JSON file containing flat objects with dot-separated keys.
Converts each flat object into a nested structure by splitting the keys at the dots and creating the appropriate nested dictionaries.
Outputs the nested objects into a new JSON file.
Usage:
bash
Copy code
python3 convert_flat_to_nested.py
Ensure that input.json is present in the same directory. The output will be written to output.json.
2. split_json_file.py
Description:
This script splits a large JSON file into smaller files, each with a maximum size of 500 KB. This is particularly helpful when dealing with large datasets that need to be imported into systems with file size limitations, such as Auth0.

How It Works:
Reads the entire JSON file into memory.
Iterates through the JSON objects, accumulating them into a batch until the batch size reaches the specified limit (500 KB by default).
Writes each batch to a separate file.
Usage:
bash
Copy code
python3 split_json_file.py
Ensure that input.json is present in the same directory. The output files will be named input_part1.json, input_part2.json, etc.
Use Case
These scripts are designed to assist in manipulating files generated by the Auth0 Import/Export extension. They address common issues when preparing these files for import into a different Auth0 tenant, such as converting flat JSON structures to nested ones and splitting large files into smaller, manageable sizes.
